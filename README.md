# face-recognition


Face recognition is a crucial security application. Through this project,
a very basic form of face recognition has been implemented using the Haar Cascades Classifier, 
openCV & K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.



# haarcascade-frontalface_alt.xml - Haar Cascade classifier is an effective object detection approach which was proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones 
in their paper, “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” in 2001
