# face-recognition


Face recognition is a crucial security application. Through this project,
a very basic form of face recognition has been implemented using the Haar Cascades Classifier, 
openCV & K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.

Technology Stack
Python — The whole code has been written in Python
cv2 — cv2 is the OpenCV module and is used here for 
reading & writing images & also to input a video stream
Algorithm — KNN
Classifier — Haar Cascades



haarcascade-frontalface_alt.xml -(https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml) Haar Cascade classifier is an effective object detection approach which was proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” in 2001
